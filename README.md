# Nanosaur

##### This is a Unity remake of the game Nanosaur. It will be one of my first public projects as a new Unity developer.


##### The core game mechanics will be around the player's velociraptor being able to double jump and use a jetpack + weapon to kill enemies. The environment will need to complement these abilities.
